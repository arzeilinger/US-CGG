Data and code from compost amended grazed grassland at Ameriflux site US-CGG

This repo contains all the data and code used in Fenster et al. 2023 "Investigating Ecosystem-Scale Responses to Compost Amendments in a Grazed Grassland" We have included fully processed eddy covariance data, including ustar filtering and footprint partitioning as well as soil data (C, N, micronutrients). We have included the code used to analyze the soil data, which uses the Gaffkeâ€™s nonparametric 90% confidence intervals approach, as well as code to analyze the Phenocam data and all code used to process eddy covariance data.
