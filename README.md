Data and code from compost amended grazed grassland at Ameriflux site US-CGG

We have uploaded here all the data and code from Fenster et al. 2023 "Investigating Ecosystem-Scale Responses to Compost Amendments in a Grazed Grassland"
This includes the eddy covariance data with ustar filtering and footpring partitioning. 
We have also included all the data and code to analyse the soil C, N, and micronutrients using the Gaffkeâ€™s nonparametric 90% confidence intervals. 
Finally, we have included the Phenocam data and code used for analysis.
